/* PARTS & PIECES */  

Prefix Free
http://leaverou.github.io/prefixfree/
Usually I use Sass and Compass to handle prefix chaos, and would never imagine an additional js library is a good idea. Then I started writing CSS for animations. The complexity of vendor prefixes inside of vendor prefixes inside of vendor prefixes was driving me nuts. Compass doesn't handle transforms, transitions and animations... now I think I know why. It's a crazy mess. I was loosing hours of time to trying to fix bugs and still not getting anywhere. So I grabbed this library. Everything just worked immediately. Bugs gone. Done and don. 

History.js
http://browserstate.github.io/history.js/demo/
This little library allows one HTML file to have internal URLs, so you can point to a specific state inside the experience (sending a link to a friend). You can also click the back button in the browser and have it work. 

Bits of HTML5 Boilerplate, http://html5boilerplate.com
Bits of 320 and Up, http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup 
I write my own HTML, but constantly steal bits and ideas from others, including from these two starterkits.

Normalize
http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css
A clean and simple reset. Only contains the bare minimum of what's needed.

jQuery, http://jquery.com
Javascript made easy.

Modernizr, http://modernizr.com
Selectivizr, http://selectivizr.com
At the moment I'm not using Modernizer and Selectvizr, but I might soon. They are good tools for helping with backwards compatibility. 


/* INSPIRATION */  

I borrowed bits of code ideas from Codepen projects. http://codepen.io
