/* PARTS & PIECES */  

Prefix Free:                  http://leaverou.github.io/prefixfree/
Usually I use Sass and Compass to handle prefix chaos, and would never imagine an additional js library is a good idea. Then I started writing CSS for animations. The complexity of vendor prefixes inside of vendor prefixes inside of vendor prefixes was driving me nuts. Compass doesn't handle transforms, transitions and animations... now I think I know why. It's a crazy mess. I was loosing hours of time to trying to fix bugs and still not getting anywhere. So I grabbed this library. Everything just worked immediately. Bugs gone. Done and don. 

jQuery History:               http://balupton.github.io/jquery-history/demo/
This little library allows one HTML file to have internal URLs, so you can point to a specific state inside the experience (sedning a link to a friend). You can also click the back button in the browser and have it work. 

bits of HTML5 Boilerplate:    http://html5boilerplate.com
bits of 320 and Up: 		      http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup 
I write my own HTML, but constantly steal bits and ideas from others, including from these two starterkits.

Normalize:                    http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css
A clean and simple reset. Only contains the bare minimum of what's needed.

jQuery: 		                  http://jquery.com
Modernizr: 	                  http://modernizr.com
Selectivizr:                  http://selectivizr.com
At the moment I'm not using Modernizer and Selectvizr, because they are needed for this project. But I might change my mind as I add backwards compatibiliy. I am using jQuery.



/* INSPIRATION */  

I borrowed bits of code ideas from Codepen projects. http://codepen.io
